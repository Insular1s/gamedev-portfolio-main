          <li><strong>Development of the Glitch Effect</strong></li>
           <ul>
              <li>A unique accessibility feature called the "Glitch Effect" was designed as a visual warning for deaf and hard-of-hearing gamers.</li>
              <li>It mimics visual static noise, increasing in intensity and frequency as an enemy approaches, helping players sense danger without relying on sound.</li>
           </ul>
          <li><strong>Comparative Study Between Analog and Digital Glitch Effects</strong></li>
           <ul>
              <li>Two variations, the Analog Glitch (resembling old television static) and the Digital Glitch (resembling dead pixels), were developed and tested.</li>
              <li>Experiments evaluated the psychological and usability impacts, showing the Analog Glitch effectively induced anxiety and enhanced the horror experience, while the Digital Glitch was preferred for modern usability.</li>
           </ul>
          <li><strong>Focus on Accessibility and Inclusivity</strong></li>
           <ul>
              <li>The study highlighted the challenge of making VR horror games accessible without altering gameplay rules.</li>
              <li>It aimed to provide an equivalent gaming experience for deaf players by replacing audio cues with visual feedback.</li>
           </ul>
          <li><strong>User-Centered Experimentation and Design</strong></li>
           <ul>
              <li>Gameplay experiments were conducted with non-impaired participants due to COVID-19 restrictions, using controlled VR environments to assess fear, immersion, and performance.</li>
              <li>Feedback showed that the Glitch Effects increased game tension and usability, enhancing both accessibility and the horror experience.</li>
